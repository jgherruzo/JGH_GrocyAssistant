# JGH_GrocyAssistant
Develop a Grocy Assistant using NodeRed, Telegram and Rhasppy

## Context
I would like to improve our control over our grocery. Track the evolution of our inventory and the cost.

I found some problems with the efficiency of using barcodes, due to you have to choose the amount of each item in the webapp, and I didn't find how to add the cost, so, at the end, you need to go to Grocy and modify some info after each shopping task.

## Goal
This proyect try to minimize the work required into grocy web app. To do that, a telegram bot will be developed in order to could load all the items you buy during the own buyimng process. In a similar way, consumption could be done throught telegram. Another options will be ask for an specific item info or ask for the shopping list.

Due to another familiar could consume or buy thing for your inventory and could not use telegram, Rhasppy will help to control this part using a voice recognision system.
